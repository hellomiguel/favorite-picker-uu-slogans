I changed it to help me whittle down choices from a bunch of Unitarian Universalist slogans I had a Generative AI make. We're making buttons to give away at street fairs.

Here's the [full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12A89ivGPV4OX7_FFAd_Kl_Ut4DSDVsVJ7zig4cHZ6II/edit?usp=sharing) of slogans I'm using. I generated them using Microsoft Copilot and Google Bard using the prompt of the slogan, "Good Theology is INCLUUSIVE," from UUCMs OutFront Justice team.
